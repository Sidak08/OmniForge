- I have no idea what I am doing
- Never made anything with hardware that has worked, non working pcb and a arduino that caught fire.
- Never used a 3d printer,

Get some what of an idea going

- bedslinger
- heated bed
- able to print
- able to CNC
- able to Engrave/laser cut
- large print volume
- screen hopefully
- maybe video monitoring
- auto level and calibrate something

Things to do
- [] Research
- [] Cad model
- [] PCB Design
- [] Code
- [] Make it work

Components
- [] Frame
- [] Print Bed
- [] movement system
- [] End stop

- [] extruder
- [] hot end
  - [] monitor the temp
- [] cooling fan

- [] controal board
